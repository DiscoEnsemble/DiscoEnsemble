<h1> </h1><b> Greetings to all, the name's Nathan </b> <br> </h1>
I'm Italian and 17 years old, Nu Metal musician, bassist and singer <br>
About myself, there's a lot I could say... <br>
For example, I'm a records collector, currently having over 100 CDs, around 50 LPs, 10 7" single vinyls and around 10 MCs <br>
I speak three languages (fluent in Italian and English, decent in German), currently studying Finnish and planning to study more languages, especially Russian <br>
I actively watch three sports; football, where I'm a Juventus fan, hockey, where I'm a Canucks fan, and Formula 1, where I'm a Ferrari fan <hr>
I'm studying programming at Enaip Torino, but by myself I mostly do some fun, personal projects, silly stuff <br>
I'm currently only studying HTML/CSS, and I'm still an amateur, so whatever I'll be doing won't be anything particularly extreme <br>
For now, this is probably gonna be the place I put whatever I do, from time to time. Again, no huge deal, just some fun stuff I'd say <br>
Enjoy!
